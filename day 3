Let's delve into Authentication and Authorization in Kubernetes.

Authentication is the process of verifying one's identity to access an application or tool, while Authorization determines the level of permissions granted.

In Kubernetes, IAM is utilized to establish Users and groups, managing the Authentication aspect.

Now, what role does RBAC play in Kubernetes? RBAC is pivotal for Authorization within Kubernetes, dictating the permissions granted to users.

Consider this scenario: A developer requires read-only access to an EKS cluster. To facilitate this, the creation of a Cluster Role and bindings is essential to grant the necessary read-only permissions.
